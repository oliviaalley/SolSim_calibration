# SolSim_calibration
The spectral measurement will report more data points than the IPCE, which has a resolution of 10 nm.
# Therefore, linear interpolation is done to allow use of as finely resolved spectral data as possible,
# which is seen to improve accuracy.
# Overall, this code performs some tasks to allow calculation of the spectral mismatch between the reference
# cell and the test cell.
